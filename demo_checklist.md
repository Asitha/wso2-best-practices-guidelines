# Demo Checklist

Use this checklist to prepare a local laptop or a workstation for a customer demo. These guidelines are there to make the demo environment as easy as possible for someone to follow, see and understand.

## 1. Keep development and demo environments separate

Create separate accounts in your machine for development work and demo work. In the development account (or profile) feel free to use dark mode everywhere and set your personal preferences. 

The demo account (profile) should follow below guidelines. This way you don't have to switch your settings at the last minute before a demo. Do this once and you only have to login to the account. No fiddling with settings at the last minute.

## 2. Use light mode

Dark mode for development and personal use is OK. The demo environment should have light mode. It’s very hard to see and follow a demo when dark mode is used across different screen resolutions. Sometimes the screensharing software reduce video which blurs everything and it's hard to see what's on the screen. 

Use light mode for Terminals, VSCode, IntegrationStudio, the browser and the theme used in the OS.

Some slides will have light text on a dark background, this is OK.

## 3. Use a lower screen resolution

A lower screen resolution should be used to make text and icons bigger everywhere. Just zooming in text alone is not enough. Applying a lower resolution should make everything bigger on your screen.
When in doubt, talk to a colleague, do a quick meeting, share the screen, and ask if it’s comfortably viewable.

## 4. Use selective zooming 

Learn how to use a zoom tool for your OS. Use this to zoom in and explain specific sections. If available, use annotation tools to annotate the screen, point, and get the attention of customers without distracting too much.

&ensp;&ensp;<kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> / <kbd>-</kbd> : Increase/decrease zoom

## 5. Use clear fonts

Use clear and neutral fonts when showing code. Default monospaced fonts comes with the OS is a safe choice. Check the default fonts for VSCode, Terminal, IntegrationStudio etc...

## 6. Switch off ALL notifications

Turn off all notifications from apps/phones/tablets,
* Google Chat
* Switch phone to silent/vibrate mode
* Discord

## 7. Close All Irrelevant Browser tabs and Windows

* Close all non-essential browser tabs and windows/apps. 
* Close any extraneous desktop windows/apps. 
* Hide extraneous extensions/bookmarks from the browser
